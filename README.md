# library-catalog
Library catalog is a demonstration of my Python skillset. I used the Google Books API to withdraw real time, accurate information about specific book statistics (title, summary, page count, ISBN, etc.). I used the Tkinter library to create a basic interface in which you can browse the selection of books.

Libraries Used:
- Tkinter
- Requests
