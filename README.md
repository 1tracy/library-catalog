# library-catalog
Library catalog is a demonstration of my Python skillset. I used the Google Books API to withdraw real time, accurate information about specific book statistics (title, summary, page count, ISBN, etc.). I used the Tkinter library to create a basic interface in which you can "check out" and "return" books from a virtual "library." Date-time functions are also used to generate a report of any "overdue" books and "fees."

Libraries Used:
Tkinter
Requests
